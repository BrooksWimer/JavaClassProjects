# JavaClassProjects
These are a collection of the class projects I completed for CS112, an introductory Java course. I placed them in the same repository because they were short weekly projects that often built on previous work. 

DataTypeProjects: 
In these projects, we built our version of common data types to better understand them.
  -MyArray
  -BigInt
  -Set
  -StringNode
  Stack:
    - Stack
    - LLStack
    - ArrayStack
  Queue:
    - Queue
    - LLQueue
    - ArrayQueue
    - PQItem
  Bag:
    - Bag
    - LLBag
    - ArrayBag
  List:
    - List
    - LLList
  Heap:
    - Heap
  HashTable:
    - HashTable
    - ChainedHashTable
    - OpenHashTable
  Tree:
    -LinkedTree
    -LinkedTreeIterator
  
AlgorithmProjects:
In these projects, we built algorithms to perform operations on the data types we studied.
  -DoubleAllStack
  -Palindrome
  -MergeApproach
  -PairFinder
  -Histogram
  -Sort
